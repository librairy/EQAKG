# Question-Answering over Knowledge Graphs


## Preparation

1. Prepare a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/) environment with  [Conda](https://docs.conda.io) installed
1. Clone this repo
	  ```
	  git clone https://github.com/librairy/MuHeQA.git
	  ```
1. Move into the root directory.
    ```
	  cd MuHeQA
	  ```
1. Download the [RDF Verbalizer model](https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/s/bRxnH93Df9Psaeo) into the `application/summary/kg/nlg/model` folder
    ```
    wget -O application/summary/kg/nlg/model/pytorch_model.bin https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/s/bRxnH93Df9Psaeo/download
    ```
1. Download the [answer classifier](https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/s/Jp5FeoBn57c8k4M) and unzip into the root project directory. The folder `resources_dir/` is created.
    ```
    wget -O resources.zip https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/s/Jp5FeoBn57c8k4M/download
    unzip resources.zip
    ```
1. Install Wikidata DB for Entity Linking:    
    ```
    python -m spacy_entity_linker "download_knowledge_base"
    ```
1. Install dependencies (in case you have a device based on Apple's M1 chip skip to the [M1 Environment](#m1-environment) step):    
		```
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		```
### M1 Environments (only for Apple's M1 devices )
1. Install the Apple edition of `tensorflow`
    ````
    pip install --upgrade --force --no-dependencies tensorflow-macos
    pip install --upgrade --force --no-dependencies tensorflow-metal
    `````
1. Compile and install the `tokenizers` module from Huggingface:
    ````
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    cd /Users/cbadenes/Projects
    git clone https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers
    cd tokenizers/bindings/python
    pip install setuptools_rust
    python setup.py install
    `````
1. Compile and install the `transformers` module from Huggingface:
    ````
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
    `````
1. And finally, install the rest of dependencies:
    ````
    pip install -r min-requirements.txt    
    ````

## Service start-up

1. Once the environment is ready, just execute the following command (`runserver` for development mode and `runprodserver` for production mode ):
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
1.  It may take some minutes to load some external resources. The following logs will appear when everything is ready:

    ```

    ```


## Server routes

The message body must contain the `question` field with the natural language question, and the query parameter `evidence` sets whether the summary generated has to be retrieved or not.

The availabe URIs are:
- `/muheqa/dbpedia` : solve questions using the English edition of DBpedia.
- `/muheqa/wikidata`: solve questions using the English edition of Wikidata.
- `/muheqa/cord19`: solve questions using the Covid-19 Open Research Dataset.
- `/muheqa/all`: solve questions using all sources of information.


## Example

To answer the question *Where was Fernando Alonso born?* using DBpedia:

   ```
    curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/muheqa/dbpedia/en?evidence=false' --form 'question="Where was Fernando Alonso born?"'
   ```

And the response:

   ```

	"confidence": 0.801,
	"evidence": {
